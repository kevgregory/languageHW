Homework 2 : implementing common algorithms and data structures such as change computation, string manipulation, file parsing, and binary search tree insertion and traversal, all using idiomatic code in both Kotlin and Java/Swift.

Homework 3 : This assignment implements functional programming concepts in TypeScript, OCaml, and Haskell, including change calculation, predicate-based application, power generation, file line filtering, 3D shapes, and a binary search tree, demonstrating type safety, immutability, and language-specific best practices.

Homework 4 : This assignment implements a stack data structure in C, C++, and Rust, focusing on manual memory management, generic programming, and idiomatic practices. Core operations like push, pop, and peek are tested to demonstrate language-specific features such as ownership in Rust and dynamic resizing in C/C++.
