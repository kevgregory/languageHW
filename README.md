Homework 2 : implementing common algorithms and data structures such as change computation, string manipulation, file parsing, and binary search tree insertion and traversal, all using idiomatic code in both Kotlin and Java/Swift.

Homework 3 : This assignment implements functional programming concepts in TypeScript, OCaml, and Haskell, including change calculation, predicate-based application, power generation, file line filtering, 3D shapes, and a binary search tree, demonstrating type safety, immutability, and language-specific best practices.
