Homework 2 : implementing common algorithms and data structures such as change computation, string manipulation, file parsing, and binary search tree insertion and traversal, all using idiomatic code in both Kotlin and Java/Swift.

Homework 3 : This assignment implements functional programming concepts in TypeScript, OCaml, and Haskell, including change calculation, predicate-based application, power generation, file line filtering, 3D shapes, and a binary search tree, demonstrating type safety, immutability, and language-specific best practices.

Homework 4 : This assignment implements a stack data structure in C, C++, and Rust, focusing on manual memory management, generic programming, and idiomatic practices. Core operations like push, pop, and peek are tested to demonstrate language-specific features such as ownership in Rust and dynamic resizing in C/C++.

Homework 5 : This assignment implements the simulation found in java to Go, Description of the code : Ten customers (Ani, Bai, Cat, Dao, Eve, Fay, Gus, Hua, Iza, and Jai) make several visits to a restaurant with three cooks (Remy, Colette, and Linguini) and only one waiter. As each customer arrives, they try to place an order with the busy waiter, who can only hold 3 outstanding orders at a time. The waiter takes the order to a free cook (if any) who prepares the meal, which takes a random amount of time (5000-10000 ms). The cook personally delivers the meal to the customer. If it takes too long (7000 ms) for a customer to get their order placed (after all, the waiter canâ€™t hold that many orders at a time), they leave the restaurant and come back later (between 2500 and 5000 ms). It takes between 1000 and 2000 ms to eat a meal. When a customer eats five meals, they go home. Only after all customers have gone home, the restaurant shuts down.
